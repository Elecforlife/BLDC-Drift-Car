# Overview

The **BLDC Drift Car** is an ESP32-powered RC car using a **BLDC motor** controlled by an **ESC** and a **servo** for steering.  
It supports two modes of operation:
1. **ESP-NOW Control** – Wireless control using another ESP32 as transmitter.
2. **PS4 Control** – Direct Bluetooth connection with a PS4 controller.

This project demonstrates:
- Wireless communication (ESP-NOW)
- BLDC motor control with ESC
- Servo steering control
- Efficient power distribution and safety design
- Optional Bluetooth PS4 input

The aim is to build a **low-cost, open-source** drift car that teaches motor control, electronics, and communication principles.
